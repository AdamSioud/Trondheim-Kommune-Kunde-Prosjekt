# Usage

The purpose of this code is to generate three files:
- ``data.geojson``
- ``data_general.json``
- ``data_interval.json``

The command to run to generate the files is ``python generate.py``

These files can then be copied and pasted into ``server/model/src/data``

The configuration to generate these files can be found in `configuration.py`, `converters.py`, `renaming.py` and `.env`.
